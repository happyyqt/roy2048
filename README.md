This is a modified clone of the game 2048, which can be seen here: [2048](https://2048game.com/)! This project is built using React, Typescript, and Sass. This also gave me an excuse to give [recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil) a try for managing theme state, which is persisted with localstorage.

### Installation
Please consider pulling the repo or downloading the project as a zip! To run locally please use a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

1) run: `npm install` to install dependancies
2) run: `npm start` to start the project.
